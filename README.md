# Blood-Pressure-Meter
Blood pressure monitor mobile app

This project is divided into two apps (Blood Pressure Meter Simulator - https://github.com/amoferreira/blood-pressure-simulator - and Blood Pressure Meter). This repo corresponds to the Blood Pressure Meter, which is an app that reads the blood pressure and heart rate from a QR code. After signing up, the user can add a new set of values and check the history of values in the form of a table or chart. It could be used by patients to monitor their blood pressures values.

This project was developed under the scope of the curricular unit Mobile Computing in Biomedical Engineering in the 2nd year of the master in Bioengineering (2021).
